# Student Feedback Portal
This is a Student Feedback Portal project that allows authenticated users (students) to submit anonymous feedback on courses and instructors. Admins (staff) should be able to view and analyze the collected feedback.

# Requirements
## Student Features
- Login (Simulated) with hardcoded user and role (Student)
- View a list of enrolled courses
- Submit anonymous feedback: Rating (1â€“5) / Text comment
- Cannot submit more than one feedback per course

# Admin Features (Staff)
- Login (Simulated) with hardcoded user and role (Admin)
- View feedback reports:
    - Course-wise aggregation
    - Instructor-wise aggregation
- Search/filter by course or instructor
- Optional: Export to Excel


# Note regarding AI
You may use AI-based coding assistants (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT) to support your development. However, you are expected to write, understand, and explain all code you submit. Copy-pasted solutions that you cannot justify will result in disqualification.
