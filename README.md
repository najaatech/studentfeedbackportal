# Student Feedback Portal

This is a Student Feedback Portal project that allows authenticated users (students) to submit anonymous feedback on courses and instructors. Admins (staff) should be able to view and analyze the collected feedback.

## Technology Stack Summary

### Backend
- .NET 9 / ASP.NET Core
- Entity Framework Core
- SQL Server
- Swagger/OpenAPI

### Frontend
- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- React 19
- CSS Modules
- Modern JavaScript/ES6+

### DevOps
- Git version control
- Package managers (NuGet, npm)

## Assessment Requirements

### Student Features
- Login (Simulated) with hardcoded user and role (Student)
- View a list of enrolled courses
- Submit anonymous feedback:
  - Rating (1â€“5)
  - Text comment
- Cannot submit more than one feedback per course

### Admin Features (Staff)
- Login (Simulated) with hardcoded user and role (Admin)
- View feedback reports:
  - Course-wise aggregation
  - Instructor-wise aggregation
- Search/filter by course or instructor
- Optional: Export to Excel

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [.NET 9](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0)
- Visual Studio Code with C# Dev Kit extension
- SQL Server

### Installation

#### Backend Setup
```bash
# Install Entity Framework tools
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef --version 9.0.6

# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend/StudentFeedback.API

# Trust development certificates
dotnet dev-certs https --trust

# Restore packages
dotnet restore

# Run the API
dotnet run --launch-profile https
```

#### Frontend Setup
```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend/StudentFeedback.APP

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

#### Database Setup
1. Copy and paste the content of `init.sql` into SQL Server Management Studio
2. Execute the script to create the database and seed data

### URLs
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: https://localhost:7222/swagger

## Note Regarding AI

You may use AI-based coding assistants (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT) to support your development. However, you are expected to write, understand, and explain all code you submit. Copy-pasted solutions that you cannot justify will result in disqualification.
